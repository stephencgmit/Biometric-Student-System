19/11/18 update.

Imported from PyCharm project folder.

Most code I've written in sqlite folder. Code contains basic student register/login system checking sqlite database for their credentials. 
If student successfully logs in, they can do a quiz which runs/ is imported from another python file
Also option for an admin user to delete students from database and show all users.

Other folders/packages currently contain basic tutorial code I've been experimenting with
