# Biometric-Student-System

19/11/18 update.

Imported from PyCharm project folder. Includes tutorial package folders. 

Most code I've written in sqlite3 folder. Code contains basic student register/login system checking sqlite database for their credentials. 
If student successfully logs in, they can do a quiz which runs/ is imported from another python file
Also option for an admin user to delete students from database and show all users.

Some integration of code done so far with mySQL & fingerprint module. In proj2019/FingerprintLoginCode/files/examples/ files, I'm using main.py to have a basic functional login system with a r307 fingerprint module on the Raspberry Pi using and developing libraries I researched would work with the RPi.
